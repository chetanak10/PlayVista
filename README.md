Problem Statement:
In India, the rapid urbanization and growing population have led to a scarcity of open
spaces for recreational sports activities, particularly affecting the youth. Traditional
methods of booking sports facilities, such as calling and checking availability, have
proven to be inefficient and cumbersome. Moreover, the lack of organized platforms has
resulted in overcrowded public gymkhanas, making it challenging for sports enthusiasts
to find suitable spaces for activities like cricket and football. Additionally, individuals
who lack a dedicated group for team sports face barriers in participation. The absence of
a streamlined solution exacerbates the sedentary lifestyle among the youth, contributing
to various mental and physical health issues.
